  "about": "**Hey there! I'm Hafiz Huzaifa Khan — a Full Stack Flutter Developer passionate about building modern, scalable mobile applications backed by powerful backend systems.** I develop seamless cross-platform apps using Flutter, while also designing and managing backend services with Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB and Firebase.\n\nCurrently, I’m working at CBSOL as an Associate Software Engineer (Full Stack Flutter), where I’m responsible for delivering production-ready mobile apps integrated with RESTful APIs. I follow clean architecture principles and use state management tools like GetX and Riverpod to ensure code quality, maintainability, and scalability. On the backend side, I build robust services that handle data efficiently and securely.\n\nMy journey started with native Android development, but I quickly embraced Flutter to deliver consistent experiences across platforms. With growing experience in backend technologies, I’m now transitioning toward becoming a complete full stack mobile developer. I'm also eager to explore tools like NestJS and PostgreSQL to further extend my backend expertise.\n\nWhether it's collaborating on a project, exploring tech innovations, or sharing ideas with fellow developers — I’m always open to meaningful connections. Let’s connect and create impactful digital experiences together!\n\n---\n---",
