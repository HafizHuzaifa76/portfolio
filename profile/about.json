    "about": "**Hey there! I'm Hafiz Huzaifa Khan, a passionate Mobile App Developer, proficient in Flutter and Android Dev (Java, Kotlin)**. With a keen interest in solving real-world challenges, I've created a variety of feature-rich, user-friendly mobile applications.\n\nMy journey began with Android development, but I've since expanded my expertise to Flutter - Google's powerful UI toolkit that enables the development of natively compiled applications across multiple platforms, including Android and iOS, all from a single codebase.\n\nCurrently, I’m working as an Associate Software Engineer at Tiers Limited, where I deliver high-quality projects that meet both client expectations and industry standards. As a Flutter Developer, I’ve contributed to various projects, leading teams and ensuring seamless app performance. Additionally, I serve as an Internship Coordinator at Tiers Limited, mentoring new interns, guiding them through essential development practices, and overseeing their project contributions.\n\nThroughout my professional roles and internships, I’ve gained hands-on experience in Firebase, MVVM, and Clean Architecture. My goal is to continue innovating and crafting user-centric apps, keeping pace with the latest advancements in technology.\n\nI am eager to connect with fellow professionals, collaborate on innovative projects, or discuss emerging tech trends. Feel free to reach out on LinkedIn. Thank you for visiting my portfolio and I look forward to exploring potential collaborations!\n\n\n---\n\n---",
